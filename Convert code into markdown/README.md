# Convert text/code into markdown

> We often find that whenever we try to comment some infomation in online forums such as in [__disqus__](https://disqus.com/) we see that a lot of special characters lose their formatting and we see some garbage/undesired values. This is because the text is displayed in special format called markdowns. These markdowns tend to use some special characters such as __"__, __'__, __>__, __<__ and __&__

> This is a python code to convert any text which contains special characters such as
> [quotation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark),
> [ampersand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand),
> [apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe),
> [	less-than sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less-than_sign) and
> [greater-than sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater-than_sign)
> into their corresponding markdown codes.
